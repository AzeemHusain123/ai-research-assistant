## 📘 Overview  
This project is an **AI Research Assistant** built using Langflow.  
It’s designed to assist users in:  
- Summarizing academic papers  
- Drafting research notes and reports  
- Generating references and citations  
- Enhancing literature review workflows  

The core workflow is stored as a Langflow JSON file (`research_assistant_flow.json`) which can be imported into Langflow and run.

---

## 🧩 How to Use  
1. Install or launch Langflow.  
2. Import the workflow JSON file.  
3. Connect your LLM provider (OpenAI key or another LLM).  
4. Input research topics, text, or questions into the assistant and receive summarized outputs.

---

## ⚠️ Notes & Requirements  
- Requires an active LLM API key.  
- Outputs should be reviewed carefully; AI-generated content may require validation.  
- Primarily intended for educational and research assistance purposes, not as a standalone authoring tool.

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes  
- Learned **prompt engineering** and building modular conversational flows.  
- Gained experience in automating research summarization tasks.  
- Applied AI to practical academic workflows.
